# Rocket_Elevators_Controllers
Contains the C#, Go , Javascript, Python and algorithm files for the elevator controllers for the New Rocket Elevator Solutions.


The project contains 4 files (battery.cs, column.cs, elevator.cs, progam.cs)

- program.cs contains the main function. scenario1 is the default function, it's uncommented.
- battery.cs contains most of functions used in the program:
     AssignElevator is function called to return an elevator when the user is on ground floor and want go up or down.
     RequestElvator is function called to return an elevator when the user is on floor and want go to ground floor.
     MoveElevator is a function called to change current floor of an elevator, direction can be  up or down.




Instruction for testing CS code :
-I have already writen the scenarios in 4 functions on battery.cs.
-Function scenario1 is the default test function.
-To test each scenario :
        go to the main function
        switch the scenario by uncommenting the relevant function.
